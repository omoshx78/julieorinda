  Her father until his death was a Lay Reader at Pap Onditi Parish, Ragen Church and was a host to many Anglican Priests and Bishops in Nyanza Region. 
  </p>
        <h2>Schooling</h2>
        <p><ul><li>Julie attended Obange primary and Ngong’a Secondary School after which she lived in Homabay with the family of Isaiah and Alice Aguttu where she studied Computer with Ellim College and helped The Aguttus  to manage their rota chemist as a family Concern. It is here that she developed interest in studying health related issues.</li><li> 
  In 2009 she was supported by Dishon Gogi, the then Homabay DASCO to find a job attachment at the Provincial Health Offices in Kisumu. She made many friends here and they have supported her during this downward journey.</li><li> 
  In 2010 she pursued Diploma in Public Relations and Marketing at St. Annes College Kisii and Diploma in Counseling Psychology with Kenya Association of Professional Counselors in Kisumu. At the time of her death, she was pursuing Diploma in Medical Records and Human Resource Management at KIM (Kisii). During the course of her work, she had also completed her job related courses of Voluntary Counseling & Testing, Adherence Counseling and Family Therapy with NASCOP.</li>
        </ul></p>
        <h2>Work</h2>
        <p class="text-center">
          <ul><li>Julie was posted to work with the Ministry of Medical Services and Public Health Sanitation at Rongo, in conjunction with Family Aids Community Education Services, while at Rongo she worshiped at ACK Emmanuel Parish, Eastern Group, she was later transferred to Migori level 4 hospital as data clerk at the P.S.C, while here, she was a member of Aroso Group of ACK St. Johns The Evangelist Parish. She was awarded for exemplary performance in helping to create a data base for nurses CDC/Emory workforce project activities.</li><li>
  By 2016, the Maryland University Health Department began to assimilate services previously done by FACES and in the process many workers were  retrenched, Julie was then deployed to Rongo but had to commute from Uriri daily for the sake of family unity.</li></ul>
  </p>
        <h2>Illness</h2>
        <p class="text-center">
          <ul>
            <li>
              Julie enjoyed a vibrant health most of her life but began feeling uncomfortable by mid 2017, soon after her 34th birthday, tests revealed that she was suffering from Ulcers but was not responding to treatment. She was first hospitalized at Migori County Referral Hospital on 9th Dec 2017 for three days treating false diagnosis. Loss of appetite, constipation, vomiting, itchy skin, rapid body waste became a worry. Doctors were clumsily cagey with information. Julie wished so much to undergo surgery but doctors’ non-verbal’s gave us uncomfortable feeling. Further tests and scans were carried out at Oasis Kisii and Avenue Kisumu which revealed she was suffering from obstructive jaundice which could be rectified by a bypass or stent insertion to re-direct bile flow. This would relive her of itchy skin, weight loss and yellow eyes.</li>
            <li>Referral to KNH and subsequent experiences there became a  like a disease of its own  as admission became so slippery, eventually after admission, the procedure was so near everyday but promises of next Tuesdays and Thursdays became the song. She was even prepared for theater raising hopes of good health but this too was another false promise.</li>
            <li>On 20th Feb, Julie was fed and prepared for sleep with hopes that the ‘golden procedure’ would be done to her the next day. Julie died waiting for the Procedure. KNH succeeded in making her part of their statistics.</li>
            <li>I came to her KNH Hospital bed the morning of 21st Feb and found her bed missing, the words of duty by nurses were ‘sorry for the loss.’ </li>
            <li>Her loss came a surprising shock for besides the anticipated procedure, any transfer may have been for purposes of tapping retention of water to relieve her of abdominal pain. As a counselor, I would deal with knowledge of anticipated death and in some small way, prepare my wife for what was coming and ask colleagues in the sacerdotal ministry to administer to her the sacrament of unction. This pains me more.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <h2>Marriage & Christian Life</h2>
        <p class="text-center">
          <ul>
            <li>Julie was the wife to the Ven. Simon Edward Onyango, Vicar of the St. Stephen's A.C.K Rombe Parish.</li>
            <li> She was a great servant of God, loving mother, loving sister, loving God mother , loving daughter in law, loving friend to many and a great servant to the community</li>
            <li>We thank the Almighty God for the opportunity he gave us to live with Julie; a lady of strong character, will, and faith, out going in matters Humanitarian. She was the chair of the Mothers Union at The St. Stephens Parish and at Akoko Arcdeaconry.</li>
              <li>The Bishop had appointed her to be a member of diocesan mothers’ union adhoc council. She became to us the epitome of the wife of noble character in proverbs. Till her last days in her ward bed, she would insist that my pastoral assignments should not be postponed. There are Christians she would want me to visit and support mostly widows and peasants. She made our house to be warm home; a place we wish to rush to always. We will miss her infectious smiles, humor, spontaneous stories and her practical spirituality. </li><li>As her husband, I endeavored to do my part in her life as I promised on our wedding day ‘for better or worse.’ There are individuals and groups who spared nothing; materials, advice, resources, time and all to save her…but we take comfort in Pauline epistle. For me to live is Christ and to die is gain. May God richly bless you.</li>
          </ul>
